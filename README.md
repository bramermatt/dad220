# 4-2 Milestone Three: Enhancement Two: Algorithms and Data Structure Narrative | Binary Search Tree Artifact Narrative


## Artifact Description
The artifact is a C++ program that implements a Binary Search Tree (BST) to manage bid information, including creating, storing, displaying, and searching for bids. Originally created as part of a coursework assignment in the "Up to Speed in C++" lab series, this program showcases fundamental and advanced C++ programming skills, particularly in the context of data structures and algorithms.

## Justification for Inclusion
I selected this artifact for my ePortfolio because it highlights my abilities in implementing and optimizing complex data structures. Specifically, the artifact demonstrates my proficiency in C++ and my understanding of efficient data management techniques. The BST implementation showcases my skills in algorithm design, while the enhancements—such as optimizing the search algorithm and handling edge cases—demonstrate my ability to improve existing code and ensure its robustness.

## Reflection on Enhancement Process
During the enhancement process, I learned the significance of writing efficient and maintainable code. Transitioning the search algorithm from a recursive to an iterative approach deepened my understanding of performance optimization. This process also highlighted the importance of thorough testing and validation to ensure that enhancements do not introduce bugs. The challenges I faced, particularly in optimizing the search algorithm and managing edge cases, were valuable learning experiences that improved my problem-solving skills and technical expertise.
