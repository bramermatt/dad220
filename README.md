## 5-2 Milestone Four: Enhancement Three: Databases Narrative

1.	Briefly describe the artifact. What is it? When was it created?

Well, this one is a bit of an interesting one. I had a little trouble getting acclimated to this program. I apparently used some JMP program while using nearly 20 lines of SQL code. I was originally looking for a larger database created with SQL. However, this is what I must work with. And I’ve now updated the file to work with both inputting users manually in the SQL or importing a CSV.

2.	Justify the inclusion of the artifact in your ePortfolio. Why did you select this item? What specific components of the artifact showcase your skills and abilities in software development? How was the artifact improved?

I struggle a bit with SQL, as I only worked with SQL once in my time with SNHU, so I thought this would be a good addition! Specific SQL syntax is going to be the best showcase of the artifact.

3.	Did you meet the course objectives you planned to meet with this enhancement in Module One? Do you have any updates to your outcome-coverage plans?

Yes, and no. Here were my enhancements: Retrieve Data, Preprocess Data, Choose Visualization, Implement Visualization, Enhance Visualization, and Interpretation. These all will be resolved by the end of the class!

4.	Reflect on the process of enhancing and modifying the artifact. What did you learn as you were creating it and improving it? What challenges did you face?

Ah, this was a fun one. Like the others I was able to come back to this nearly completely fresh. I hadn’t looked at the old assignments in a long time – for some. And it was good to come back. I did, however, sign up for a subscription for JMP a program that uses SQL to visualize data. It was something we used in the DAT220 class. Being a student, I was able to get a subscription for a full year free! I am still learning a lot, as I parse the data, and the code. SQL is a fun and understandable language that I hope to use in my career as a software engineer!
